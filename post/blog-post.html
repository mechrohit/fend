        <p>
          I love wandering through the streets of Jharkhand Jamshedpur, finding new places popping up at every corner. The city is constantly reinventing itself which was one of the reason I came back to my home city after many years Karnataka. When asked about my experience, I can only respond:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Jamshedpur is the city of my dreams: Modernity and tradition are fusing together and constantly give birth to new creations of light and shadow. It is true that the city never sleeps. The neon lights are flickerung 24/7 and bathing the city in its signature glow and giving me life.</blockquote>
        <p>
          Now teaching at <em>Ranchi University</em> I spents my days at the university, but the night is when I truly come alive. Walking through the city on the verge of light and shadow, I discover the most <strong>astonishing, ugly, beautiful places</strong>. Many people are questioning my love for Jamshedpur's imperfections, but as in the art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshedpur">Jamshedpur</a>, true beauty often lies beneath the surface.

          <p>
          I hope that more and more people will see the true beauty of Jamshedpur soon. It is a captivating beast that you won't be able to take your eyes of again. Explore the city in your own pace and <u>discover things you have never seen before</u>.
